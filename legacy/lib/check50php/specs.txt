Need to specify what is and is not supported for testing and/or run50
Things to consider:
Std in/out/err
File IO / Network socket IO (basically any file descriptor operation)
Random number generators (can manipulate srand)
Gettimeofday / timing code
Need to get around any macros which override default behavior of functions / system calls (like pset6)
Forking / execing processes / IPC / Pthreads
getpid / ppid / group id / user id
32-bit vs 64-bit stuff (sizeof, etc.), other machine dependent syscalls/stuff
Soft/hard resource limits
Can't do anything with "root" unless VM
(ptrace?)
